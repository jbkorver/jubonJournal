Starting on January 1, 2021 we do a complete inventory.  In an attempt to not have to count so many items, the week before we start inventory, we have our biggest 
sale of the year.  The sale starts on Saturday, December 26 from 10:07 a.m. - 3:13 p.m. with 50% off all notions.  
That includes Guttermann thread, Dill buttons and Clover knitting needles.  Eventually we only plan on carrying the 
Gutermann thread, but we still have quite a few other notions.
</p>
<p class="bodyTextP">
Starting Monday, December 28, all disc golf items will be 50% off.  That includes all single discs, 
disc golf sets and a few items of Innova clothing.  We try keep up with the new discs that are produced 
by Innova and have a nice selection (just as many as when we had the bricks and mortar building downtown).  
On Monday we will be open from 10:07 a.m. - 5:14 p.m. 
</p>
<p class="bodyTextP">
Tuesday, December 29, we will feature wooden shoes, wooden shoe slippers and garden clogs.  All items on hand 
will be 50% off.  We have four different styles of wooden shoes (these are all made in the Netherlands).  
We have plain ones, these are the least expensive and you can get very creative with them, by painting them, 
cutting them down, etc.  We have the traditional shoes, red mill shoes and a few pair of wedding shoes.  
The wedding shoes are hand carved and the man who did that for my suppliers has passed away and they haven't found 
someone to replace him yet, so I only have a few pair of them left.  We will be open on Tuesday from 10:07 a.m - 5:13 p.m.
</p>
<p class="bodyTextP">
Wednesday, December 30, I call our miscellaneous sale day.  Almost anything that doesn't have it's special day will be 50% off.  
That includes books, puzzles, all Dutch items (except for shoes and food), jewelry, etc.  We will be open from 10:07 a.m. - 5:13 p.m.  
I will be gone from about 1:30 p.m. - 3:30 p.m., but my husband, Lee, can help you at that time. 
</p>
<p class="bodyTextP">
Thursday, December 31, all Dutch food will be 50% off.  We still have quite a bit of Christmas chocolates left.  
That includes quite a few letters, although the selection of a specific letter may be hard to find.  At this time we only have a 
few boxes of white peppermints left, but we still have some chocolate Santas.  We also have poffertjes pans and mix.  
 
</p>
<p class="bodyTextP">
Don't forget that we are now located at 204 Iowa Avenue NW.  That is about four blocks straight west of where our 
store used to be.  We have a little open/close sign in front of the garage.  Just come in the garage and we have a 
little office at the back with a Dutch door.  You can also order anything by phone.  Just call 712-737-8920.  
We hope to hear or see many of you the week after Christmas.

<span style="font-style: italic">The Princes in the Tower</span> by Allison Weier</div>
This is not a fiction book, but is written by an historian and offers more than one theory as to what happened to 
Edward V and Richard, Duke of York.  They were two young boys that should have followed their father, King Edward IV 
as king of England.  However, their uncle, Richard III, had other ideas.  Most of the action occurs in 1483.  
I spent a good deal of my time reading this book studying "A Simplified Genealogy" in the back of the book.  
It starts with Edward III who ruled England from 1312 - 1377 and goes through Henry VII who ruled from 1454 - 1509.  
Many of the names are followed by the symbol of a cross (meaning they were murdered), the sign of two swords 
crossing (meaning they were killed in battle), or an ex.(which means they were executed).  Of course many of 
these atrocities were carried out by family members.  I thought it was going to be kind of dry at first, but it 
turned out to be a very interesting book, if you are interested in old English history.  It is a soft cover and sells for $3.00.

<span style="font-style: italic">The Dogs of Babel</span> by Carolyn Parkhurst</div>
The front of the book says it is a National Bestseller, but it was a little different.  
At first I didn't think I would like it at all, but I hate to give up on a book.  It took me until about the 
sixth chapter to decide that it was worth finishing.  It's a novel that was selected a main selection of the 
book of the month club.  I suspect they sometimes pick "different" kinds of stories.  This is the story of a 
linguistic professor whose wife dies by falling out of an apple tree.  The only witness was their dog, a large 
Rhodesian Ridgeback.  Our story teller decides he is going to teach the dog, Lorelei, to talk so that she can 
tell him what actually happened to his wife. It is a pretty easy read and quite entertaining once you get into it.  
I just have one copy and it is a softcover for $3.00.  Neither of these are the small paperbacks.

<div style="font-weight:bold">
<span style="font-style: italic">Letters from Ralph</span> and was written by my husband, Lee, and myself and copyrighted in 2014.</div> 
I can't believe it was that long ago already.  It took us about three years to write it.  
It contains the contents of the actual letters that Ralph Mouw wrote home when he was in the Army from September 
1941 through the end of the war.  In-between each letter, Lee inserts what was actually happening during the war.  
His letters were censored and he couldn't say too much about even where he was located.  Ralph had many interesting 
experiences including the Battle of the Bulge and liberating some concentration camps.  It also contains pictures 
and maps.  This is all a true story about a local college professor that both Lee and I had in college.  He was 
probably one of the best teachers ever to teach at Northwestern College.  This is a nice hard cover book and sells for $39.95.

Former Building<br><span class="by">By Owner: Bonnie Meier</span>
	</p>
	<p class="bodyTextP">

Almost two years ago we started planning the closing of our former building (or was it three years -- time goes fast).  
Anyway, after cleaning everything out of the building we sold the building to Katy Schuller in August of 2019.  
Katy has a rental business for weddings and other gatherings and was looking for a downtown location to house all of her things.  
Then Covid hit and her business slowed down a bit.  However, in the meantime she did a lot of remodeling in our former building.  
She is very artistic and also loves history so she tried to renovate the building to its original architecture.  
She removed the carpet and has the original wood on the floor.  One of the walls is down to the original brick.  
She found some really old wood down the basement and has made use of everything old she could find.  The original building 
burned down in 1903 and was rebuilt as a bakery in 1904.  I just gave her some information about the building since it was 
built in case she wants to apply for a place on the Historical Register -- which it surely should qualify for.  
Anyway, if you are in Orange City, you might want to stop in to see what she has done with the building.  
She is open on Mondays, but most of her business is by appointment so if you want to see it other days, you have to call for an appointment.

Our next big project is taking inventory.  It often takes most of January to count everything.  
After that we will start planning for the Tulip Festival.  Last year we were supposed to celebrate our 
80th Tulip Festival, but since it was cancelled, 2021 will be our 80th.  As soon as we get new brochures, 
I'll start summarizing Tulip Festival events.  The Queen and her court have already been elected and, 
hopefully, this year this can be more than just figureheads.
