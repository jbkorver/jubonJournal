  <span class="by">By Owner: Bonnie Meier</span></p>
 
<p class="bodyTextP">
I can’t remember the last time that we had three beautiful days of Tulip Festival with no rain.  
Wednesday night, when the rides open for the kids, was almost perfect weather, without even any wind.  
Some of the tulips hung on enough to be pretty so that people could take pictures of them.  All-in-all 
Tulip Festival was a great success this year and we are grateful for the wonderful weather.  I would 
like to thank all of our help, i.e. Margaret, Sharon, Louise, Arlys, Idelle and Fran for their hard 
work during the Festival.  We couldn’t have served the people without you.

  <span class="by">By Owner: Bonnie Meier</span></p>
 
<p class="bodyTextP">
One of the additions to our store during this years Tulip Festival, was someone devoted to doing nothing but 
helping people find the right fit for their wooden shoes, slippers and/or garden clogs.  Dan Hurt spent about 
15 hours this weekend helping people find the right shoes.  Dan dressed in a very nice authentic Dutch 
costume along with wooden shoes himself and was a great addition to our staff for the festival.  
In fact, Dan looked so authentic that we had customers ask if they could take pictures of him or with him.  
I’m not sure Dan was so crazy about that, but he was a good sport and let them. 
This greatly freed up our clerking staff who went a little crazy last year trying to check people out and 
helping with shoes on top of that.  We already have him reserved to come back next year. Dan did take 
time off to participate in Thursday’s parade.  He had his big Labrador dog pull a cart with his granddaughter 
in it.  He refurbished the cart from one that was used by a local veterinarian to pull his children in the 
parade in the 1940s. <br/>

  <span class="by">By Owner: Bonnie Meier</span></p>

<p class="bodyTextP">On Saturday morning I took a little time to participate in an Author’s corner on the 
court house lawn to promote our book "Letters from Ralph".  Our daughter, Juliana, had taught me how to 
use the Square on my telephone so that I could take payments from credit cards.  I had to use it a
 couple of times.  I had some very patient customers because technology does not come as easily to me 
 as the next generation, but we got the job done and I think we sold a few extra books because of it.  
 I don’t think I’ll take the time away from the store next year to do this again, so we will keep 
 reminding people through our newsletter that you can purchase the book by clicking on our web site at 
 the left side of this newsletter.  
 </p>
 
 <p class="bodyTextP">Art Burst and the Author’s Corner were very successful this year.  There were 
 32 artists who set up tents to sell their wares and there were some beautiful products displayed.  
 Last year there were only 20 vendors so you can see how successful it was this year.  There were five 
 authors who set up including Renae B. Vander Schaaf who has her second book out entitled "A Place of New Beginnings".  
 This is a sequel to her first book "A Place of Refuge". Both books are based on historical facts.  
 I just finished reading her second book and enjoyed it completely.  It takes place in 1870 and tells about 
 the wagon train of people who travelled from Pella to Northwest Iowa and established the town of Orange City.  
 It also describes how people homesteaded and built sod houses so that they could spend time on the land and 
 eventually become owners of it.  They would have to travel to LeMars to get supplies, which was a pretty 
 involved process.  We carry both her books at the store.   Another author was James C. Schaap who has 
 written several books, which we also carry at the store.

  <span class="by">By Owner: Bonnie Meier</span></p>

<p class="bodyTextP">
In an earlier newsletter you heard about how we met Jake Van Wyk when we saw the rider-less horse while driving
home one day.  We now feature many of Jake’s works at our store including etchings, prints and pottery.  
My daughter, Juliana, and I had the privilege of touring Jake’s private studio a couple of weeks ago and were 
very impressed.  We even saw a new sculpture on which he is working.  He is a very accomplished artist and 
has taught for many years.  We now have the honor of offering one of his classes to the first 15 people who 
sign up for it.  He will teach a Plein Aire style class on July 20 from 2:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m. in that back room of 
our store.  Plein Aire means painting "out in the open" and it will cover gesture sketching, basic design, 
distance techniques and color palette layout.  You need to bring your own supplies we will include two 
small canvasses, paints and brushes.  – More about that in the June newsletter.  We may try to carry a few 
of those here or let you know where you can purchase them, if you don’t have them.  My assignment is to 
get the back room cleaned up enough to make it an art studio for a day.  It is a very large room that has 
just been used for storage up to this point.  It will be good to make that usable space.  We already 
have two people signed up for the class and we haven’t even advertised it yet.  The class is for beginner 
and intermediate painters.  If you would like to sign up, please call 712-737-8920 or e-mail me at 
jubonjuweelen@gmail.com  I think it will be an educational afternoon of fun and I’m hoping that this is the beginning 
of more learning opportunities at Jubon Juweelen.  There is a $35 charge for the class.  </p>

  <span class="by">By Co-Owner: Bonnie Meier</span></p>

<p class="bodyTextP">
Our guest book got such a workout this month, that I didn't notice we had run out of pages and someone had just 
inserted a plain piece of paper to list all the names.  They didn't realize that I had extra pages underneath the 
podium where we keep the guest book.  I don't believe I've ever told the story of where the podium came from.  
When you first enter the store we have an attractive wood podium right to your left with our guest book on it.  My Grandfather, 
Gerrit Vis, worked in the court house in the early 1900s.  When he was 29 years old he came down with a serious disease 
called pernicious anemia.  He got very sick and he was put on a train to go to Rochester, Minnesota to try to find a cure.  
While he was there, he died – at the age of 29.  My Grandmother was left a widow with a three-year-old boy (my father) and 
a new house with no income.  By the way, they found a cure for pernicious anemia a few years later.  Anyway, my Grandmother 
gave this wood podium to Trinity Church in memory of Grandpa Vis.  There is a brass plaque on the front of it saying that 
it was given in his memory in 1919.  It was used at the church for many years and when Trinity built a new church a few years 
ago I happily acquired it.  To go on with the story of Grandma who no longer had income from my Grandpa, she rented out 
rooms in their big new house to borders in order to make a living.  One of her first renters was my husband’s father 
who was a new young dentist who moved to Orange City in 1919 to establish a dental practice.  Who would have guessed 
that almost 80 years later Dr. Meier’s son and grandma’s granddaughter would be married?  
</p>

<p class="bodyTextP">
Anyway, getting on to our guests, this month we had visitors from California, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, 
and all over Iowa.  People also visited from several countries including Alberta, Canada; Ontario, Canada; Stavanger, Norway; 
Saitama, Japan and Columbia, South America.  And those were just the ones who signed our guest book. </p><br>
